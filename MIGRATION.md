# Migration to React + Vite Standard Structure

## Summary

Successfully converted the Rankly project from a hybrid setup (standalone HTML files + React components) into a unified **React + Vite + React Router** application.

## What Changed

### ✅ Added
- **React Router DOM** (`^6.22.0`) for client-side routing
- **Pages directory** (`src/pages/`):
  - `Onboarding.tsx` - Complete onboarding flow (moved from App.tsx)
  - `Dashboard.tsx` - Dashboard with prompt management (converted from HTML)
- **Layout component** (`src/components/Layout.tsx`):
  - Unified header with branding
  - Sidebar navigation
  - Theme toggle with persistence
  - Contact link
- **Routing structure** in `App.tsx`:
  - `/` → Onboarding
  - `/onboarding` → Onboarding  
  - `/dashboard` → Dashboard with sidebar
  - `/*` → Redirect to home

### ❌ Removed
- `dashboard.html` (496 lines)
- `dashboard-final.html` (1,029 lines)
- `dashboard-react.html` (475 lines)
- `dashboard-refined.html` (1,028 lines)
- `dashboard-shadcn.html` (950 lines)
- `react-flow-dashboard.html` (515 lines)
- `tree-visualization.html` (503 lines)
- `server.js` (55 lines)

**Total removed**: ~5,000 lines of prototype/standalone code

### 🔄 Modified
- `package.json` - Added `react-router-dom`
- `src/App.tsx` - Simplified to routing only (from 1,300+ lines to 25 lines)
- `README.md` - Updated with new structure and instructions

## New Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/                 # shadcn/ui components (unchanged)
│   └── Layout.tsx          # NEW: Main layout wrapper
├── pages/
│   ├── Onboarding.tsx      # NEW: Full onboarding flow
│   └── Dashboard.tsx       # NEW: Dashboard page
├── lib/
│   └── utils.ts            # Unchanged
├── App.tsx                 # CHANGED: Now just routing
├── main.tsx                # Unchanged
└── globals.css             # Unchanged
```

## How to Run

### Development
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Navigation Flow

1. **Start** → `/` (Onboarding)
2. **Complete Onboarding** → Click "Open Dashboard" → `/dashboard`
3. **Dashboard** → Shows sidebar with navigation + prompt management

## Features Preserved

All functionality from the original HTML prototypes has been preserved:

### Onboarding
- ✅ Email + Google OAuth
- ✅ 6-digit verification
- ✅ User info collection
- ✅ Website URL analysis with animated loader
- ✅ Competitor management (add/edit/remove)
- ✅ Topic selection
- ✅ Persona configuration
- ✅ Region & language selection
- ✅ Metrics display (visibility, citations, opportunities)

### Dashboard
- ✅ Tab navigation (Prompts, Visibility, Sentiment, Topics, Citations)
- ✅ Collapsible topic sections
- ✅ Prompt CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ✅ Prompt chaining visualization
- ✅ Sidebar navigation
- ✅ Theme toggle (dark/light)

## Technical Improvements

1. **Single Page Application**: No more switching between HTML files
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage across all pages
3. **Code Reusability**: Shared Layout component
4. **Better UX**: Seamless navigation without page reloads
5. **Maintainability**: All code in one place with clear structure
6. **Scalability**: Easy to add new pages/routes
7. **Performance**: Vite's fast HMR and optimized builds

## Breaking Changes

### For Developers
- Old URLs (`dashboard.html`, etc.) no longer work
- Must use React Router paths (`/dashboard`)
- Theme state is now managed in Layout component

### For Users
- **None** - All features work the same way

## Next Steps

To continue development:

1. **Add Backend Integration**:
   ```typescript
   // Example: Add API calls in Dashboard.tsx
   const fetchPrompts = async () => {
     const response = await fetch('/api/prompts')
     return response.json()
   }
   ```

2. **Add Authentication**:
   ```typescript
   // Example: Protect routes
   <Route 
     path="/dashboard" 
     element={<ProtectedRoute><Dashboard /></ProtectedRoute>}
   />
   ```

3. **Add More Pages**:
   ```typescript
   // Create src/pages/Analytics.tsx
   <Route path="/analytics" element={<Analytics />} />
   ```

4. **Add State Management** (if needed):
   ```bash
   npm install zustand
   # or
   npm install @tanstack/react-query
   ```

## Rollback

If you need to rollback to the old structure:

```bash
git log --oneline  # Find commit before migration
git checkout <commit-hash>
```

Or restore from backup if you saved one.

## Testing Checklist

After running the app, verify:

- [ ] Onboarding flow completes end-to-end
- [ ] Theme toggle works and persists
- [ ] Dashboard navigation works
- [ ] Prompts can be added/edited/deleted
- [ ] Collapsible topics open/close properly
- [ ] Routing works (back/forward buttons)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Builds successfully (`npm run build`)
