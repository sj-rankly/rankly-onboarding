## 🤔 FAQ

### Q: Do I need to read all 3 documents?
**A**: Read summary first, then detailed requirements, then use checklist during development.

### Q: Can I skip sections?
**A**: Follow priority levels. P0 first, then P1, then P2. P3 can wait.

### Q: I'm stuck on a feature, what do I do?
**A**: 
1. Check `BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md` for that feature
2. Look at frontend code to see expected behavior
3. Check if there's a testing section in checklist
4. Search online for specific tech (e.g., "Express JWT authentication")

### Q: The documents are too long!
**A**: Use `BACKEND_FEATURES_SUMMARY.md` for 90% of development. Only dive into `BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md` when you need details.

### Q: Can I change the tech stack?
**A**: Yes, but documents assume Node.js + Express + MongoDB. If using different stack, adapt accordingly.

### Q: How accurate is the timeline?
**A**: 8-10 weeks is realistic for someone with backend experience working full-time. Add 50% more time if learning as you go.
