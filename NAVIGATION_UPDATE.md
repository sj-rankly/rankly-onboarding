## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Data Persistence**
- All entered data is preserved when going back
- Uses `OnboardingContext` to maintain state
- No data loss when navigating backward

### 2. **Smart Placement**
- **Steps 1-4**: Back button integrated in form layout
- **Steps 5-7**: Back button in header AND right panel
- **Step 8**: Back button adapts based on current sub-state

### 3. **Visual Consistency**
- All back buttons use `← Back` format
- Outline variant for secondary action
- Consistent sizing and spacing

### 4. **Dual Navigation on Right Panel**
For steps 5-7, users can navigate from either:
- **Left panel** (form area): Small back button in header
- **Right panel**: Large back/next buttons for easy access

---

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Button Styles

**Primary (Continue/Next)**:
```typescript
<Button size="lg" className="flex-1">
  Continue / Next →
</Button>
```

**Secondary (Back)**:
```typescript
<Button variant="outline" size="lg">
  ← Back
</Button>
```

### State Management
```typescript
// All data persists via OnboardingContext
const { data, updateData } = useOnboarding()

// Navigation preserves all entered information
setCurrentStep(previousStep)
```

### Special Cases

**Loading States**:
- No back button during analysis animation (Step 4 → Step 5 transition)
- Back button reappears after loading completes

**Metrics View**:
- Back button resets state: `setShowMetrics(false)`
- Returns to Region/Language form
- Allows re-generating with different settings
